# SampleFinder

## Description

Chops up songs into 1 second segments, and tries to find the closest thing to a user-provided sample or a random sample in the songs using DSP techniques. 

## Usage
```python
python main.py song_folder sample_wav
```

Both arguments are optional (folder will default to `audio`) and order-agnostic.
